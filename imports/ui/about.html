                    In the real world I'm Ken Walker and you can find me on
                    <a href="https://www.facebook.com/djembe.head"
                        target="_blank">Facebook</a> and on Twitter
                    <a href="https://twitter.com/kwalker" target="_blank">@kwalker</a>. In the non-real world I participate in a Live Action Role Playing game known as
                    <a href="https://amtgard.com">Amtgard</a>.
                </p>

                    We have a lot of
                    <i>feasts</i> in Amtgard with participants into the hundreds. When cooking for these events there was no
                    good way to ask for or get the dietary restrictions of the participants and that lead me to writing this application.
                </p>
                <p>If you think something is missing in the application or find a bug, please use the email above and contact
                    me. If you're a developer you could put an issue on the
                    <a href="https://github.com/kenwalker/feastaid">FeastAid Github</a> page.
                </p>

                    I've made a couple of other applications for Amtgard.
                    <a href="http://www.easygard.ca">Easygard</a> is a mobile friendly site for the Amtgard rules. The site
                    <a href="https://amtquest.com">AmtQuest</a> tracks the whereabouts of a piece of hardware called the AmtQuest Chest as it geo-tags the
                    Amtgard world.
