                FeastAid is a Web application that utilizes your Facebook login. When you first login you are asked to grant FeastAid
                access to your personal profile and your user events. To be clear, FeastAid stores your Name, Facebook Unique
                ID, Facebook link and gender range. If you are a Facebook Event organizer FeastAid also retrieves the list
                of who is attending your event in the form of a username and Facebook Unique ID. FeastAid cannot modify
                any of your Facebook data.
                <br>
                <br> FeastAid also records locally your preferences for your Allergy and Dietary concerns. FeastAid never publishes
                this information with your Name or Facebook ID. The data is anonymized on the server and only sums and totals
                are sent back to the client.
